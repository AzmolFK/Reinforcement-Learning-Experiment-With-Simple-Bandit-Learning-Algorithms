# Reinforcement-Learning-Experiment-With-Simple-Bandit-Learning-Algorithms
Our goal will be to experiment with some simple bandit learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch and comparing their performance in terms of (1) the average accumulated reward as well as (2) the proportion of time the optimal action, i.e., the one with the highest expected reward, is taken.
